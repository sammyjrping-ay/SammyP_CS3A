					<h2>Childhood</h2>
					<p>
						I am Sammy Jr. T. Ping-ay, born on October 10, 2004, at Lorma Medical Center in Carlatan, San Fernando City, La Union. 
During my childhood, I spent most of my time playing games with my cousins. We enjoyed traditional Filipino games like 
tagu-taguan, boom base, ovalitine, entrance, and agawan base. When it came to digital games, we played Plants vs. 
Zombies, Temple Run, Sonic Dash, and Clash of Clans on mobile devices. We also spent hours on PSP, particularly 
enjoying X-Men vs. Street Fighter. Some of my fondest childhood memories were bonding with my cousins through 
these games. 
					</p>
					<p>
						As I grew older, my interests expanded beyond gaming. I developed a love for chess and found a strong passion for 
math and science, which later influenced my academic journey. 
					</p>

					<h2>Elementary Years</h2>
					<h3>Academics</h3>
					<p>
						During my elementary days, I was very active in school, participating in almost every contest and academic activity 
available. My motivation to excel started when my mother and I talked about my older cousin, Kuya Walter, who was 
a first honor student. That conversation inspired me to aim for academic achievements, and with determination, I 
excelled in my studies during my elementary years.
					</p>
					<h3>Sports</h3>
					<p>
						In Grade 3, I joined the chess team and became a school representative. Although I lost my first competition, I didn’t 
take it too seriously since I was still young and had plenty of room for improvement. I was also one of the youngest 
participants in that tournament. By Grade 4, I found chess boring, so I shifted my sport to badminton. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In Grade 5, I discovered a greater passion for volleyball, which I enjoyed more than badminton. Then by Grade 6, I 
was playing both badminton and volleyball competitively. That same year, my teachers insisted that I participate in 
chess again. I initially resisted, even to the point of crying, because I was told I wouldn’t be allowed to play volleyball 
or badminton unless I joined the chess tournament. So, I ended up competing in all three sports. However, in the 
chess competition, I intentionally lost 0-3 right away so I could focus on badminton and volleyball, which were the 
sports I truly loved.
					</p>
					<h3>Love Life</h3>
					<p>
						I had my first crush in Grade 3—Kristel, one of my classmates. At the time, it felt like innocent puppy love, but my 
feelings were inconsistent; sometimes I was interested in her, and other times I wasn’t. Later, I discovered that she 
was actually a distant relative, which was quite a surprise. Despite that, we remained good friends. Now, Kristel, along 
with Jessi and Jovial, is part of my close circle of friends.

					<h2>Junior High School Years</h2>
					<h3>Academics</h3>
					<p>
						I studied at Regional Science High School for Region I, though I originally wanted to enroll at PRPMA in Sta. Cruz. 
However, my parents preferred RSHS since my cousins and older sister also studied there. This school was a 
humbling experience for me. Almost every student here was a top honor student in elementary—1st, 2nd, or at least 
in the top 10. That’s when I realized I wasn’t as exceptional as I once thought. In elementary, I stood out, but here, I 
was just an average student, both in terms of grades and performance. Many of my classmates were highly 
academically driven, with some even competing in international contests, which sometimes made me feel like they 
were out of my league. 
					</p>
					<p>
						My Grade 7 and 8 years were manageable, but things became difficult in Grade 9, especially with research. By the 
third quarter, my classmates were already preparing for their mock title defense, while my group still didn’t have a 
finalized research topic. We kept changing our title, which delayed our progress. By the fourth quarter, we were at 
risk of being dropped from the subject, and our parents were even called to school. That month was one of the most 
stressful times in my life—we worked almost nonstop, barely sleeping, and I even considered transferring schools. 
But thankfully, we managed to complete our research and still get passed. 
					</p>
					<p>
						By Grade 10, things were much easier because I had already learned how research worked. This time, I even became 
the group leader. However, I realized how expensive it was to conduct research, which was another challenge.
					</p>
					<h3>Sports</h3>
					<p>
						In Grade 7 and 8, I initially played badminton because I felt my volleyball skills weren’t strong enough to keep up with 
others. They could spike and serve overhand, while I could only do underhand serves and wasn’t familiar with the 
three-touch gameplay. So, I stuck with badminton for the time being. However, in Grade 9, I became more dedicated 
to volleyball. At first, I returned to the sport because my crush often watched the games, but over time, I genuinely 
grew to love it. By Grade 10, I fully committed to volleyball, trying out and earning a spot on the team as an open 
spiker. At first, I had no idea what that position meant, but through training, I gradually learned my role. My 
understanding of volleyball deepened as I familiarized myself with different positions and gameplays. I truly enjoyed 
playing volleyball despite the exhaustion, especially when my crush would watch and even compliment how good we 
looked in our volleyball outfits. Our training schedule alternated between Tuesday-Thursday and Monday-Wednesday
Friday, while Saturdays were either half-day or whole-day sessions. 
					</p>
					<h3>Love Life</h3>
					<p>In Grade 9, a girl named Rhessa had a crush on me during the first quarter—I even remember her asking for a picture 
with me. At the time, I didn’t feel the same way. But by the third quarter, I somehow started liking her. Ironically, by 
then, she had already moved on. She was probably my biggest crush because, in my eyes, she was truly beautiful. 
Before Grade 10, during the vacation, I started developing feelings for my close friend, Gee Jette. We had been friends 
since Grade 9, but during the break of Grade 9 to 10, we started seeing each other differently and started to develop 
feelins for each other. We eventually became MU (mutual understanding), but our relationship didn’t work out due to 
our different beliefs and perspectives. Despite that, she played a big role in my volleyball journey, as she was the 
reason I get back to playing volleyball in Grade 9 and tried out for the team in Grade 10.</p>

					<h2>Senior High School Years</h2>
					<h3>Academics</h3>
					<p>I continued my Senior High School education at Regional Science High School for Region I (RSHS) under the STEM 
strand. However, due to the pandemic, our learning system was online modular, which made academics feel less 
serious. Our school provided modules while also conducting online classes, and we had to submit our outputs either 
via Google Classroom or by physically passing them to a teacher in Tagudin, who would then forward them to the 
school. </p>
					<p>Looking back, I felt like my two years in SHS were wasted. The online modular setup didn’t provide much learning, 
and most of us simply copied answers from each other. From Friday to Wednesday, we did nothing, then on Thursday, 
my friends and I divided the workload and finished everything quickly.</p>
					<p>Regarding research, my Grade 11 experience was easier because my groupmates carried most of the work. By Grade 
12, the situation reversed, and I ended up doing most of the work. Research in SHS was manageable, mainly because 
of my previous experience in junior high school. But overall, SHS felt uneventful—as if it didn’t happen at all. </p>
					<h3>Sports</h3>
					<p>I had high hopes for volleyball in Senior High because, back in Grade 10, younger players like me were being trained 
to take over the team once the older players graduated. I assumed that by SHS, I would have more opportunities to 
play and even become the team captain. However, the pandemic changed everything. In Grade 10, I only got to play 
once, and that was during the final moments of a match. I expected more playtime in Senior High, but with 
competitions canceled, I lost motivation and eventually stopped playing altogether. Now, I’m considering returning to 
the sport, hoping to reignite my passion for it.</p>
					<h3>Love Life</h3>
					<p>In Senior High, I developed feelings for Krishianne, a close friend since Grade 8 and she was my classmate from 
Grade 8 to Grade 11. We started getting closer in Grade 11 as study buddies, and that’s when we gradually developed 
feelings for each other. </p>
					<p>I still remember how we confessed—it happened through a 1v1 match in Mobile Legends. The rule was that whoever 
lost had to admit their crush. She lost, confessed first, and after that, I admitted my feelings too. From there, we 
decided to take things slowly and get to know each other better.</p>
					<p>We were in a good relationship for about three months before we had our first minor conflict. The issue remained 
unresolved, and over time, it became a repeated argument. She often brought it up, wanting to know the secrets of 
my female friends, which they had entrusted to me. I refused to tell her, as I felt it wasn’t right to betray their trust. </p>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Career</h3>
					<p>Our relationship lasted 10 months, but in the end, I was the one who decided to break things off. I won’t go into 
details about the reason, but after a year and a few months, we ended up rekindling our connection. </p>
				</section>
				<section id="college">
					<h2>College</h2>
					<h3>Academics</h3>
					<p>So far, my academic performance in college has been going well—no failing grades yet, and I think I’m keeping up 
just fine (with the help of GPT, haha!). My scores are surprisingly high, to the point that I sometimes feel like I don’t 
deserve them, and I’m not even sure how I’m getting such grades. </p>
					<p>Back in high school, I was made to believe that I was just an average student, so this sudden shift feels overwhelming. 
It’s also quite stressful when people expect a lot from you. In my first year, many assumed I was naturally good at 
programming, but the truth is, I self-studied the fundamentals during the break between Senior High and college. 
That early preparation helped me excel in programming during my first semester.</p>
					<h3>Sports</h3>
					<p>When it comes to sports, I didn’t join any teams at first because I wanted to focus on academics. Plus, after being 
inactive for almost two years due to the pandemic, I worried that I might become a liability to the team. </p>
					<p>In my second year, I finally played volleyball again during CS Week, and it felt completely different. I struggled to 
control my serves, my jump felt lower, my endurance had decreased, and overall, my gameplay had significantly 
weakened. I hadn’t planned on playing, but Emerson invited me, and I realized that I missed the sport.</p>
					<p>Now, in my third year, I decided not to join because the academic workload is overwhelming. I simply don’t have the 
time for volleyball, and I don’t want my studies to suffer because of it. Maybe next year, I’ll give it another shot. </p>
					<h3>Love Life</h3>
					<p>In my first year, my ex, Krishianne, and I got back together, and this time, we took the relationship more seriously. 
We even met up often since I would sneak away to Baguio just to see her. Since she’s also taking BSCS, we always 
had something to talk about. </p>
					<p>However, after eight months, we broke up again—this time, she was the one who ended it. I don’t remember the 
exact details, but I know it was because I was a "red flag." Despite that, we still talk occasionally, mostly about 
academics or tech-related stuff. </p>
					<p>Since the breakup, I haven’t been in a relationship, and I don’t even have a crush right now, which is unusual for me 
since I always had one before. Maybe I’ll start looking for someone again next school year.</p>
					<h3>Friendship</h3>
					<p>In college, I became close friends with Brigitte and Rhovic. At first, I was closer to Brigitte since she was more focused 
on academics than Rhovic and had a genuine and sincere personality. However, after about a month, I became closer to Rhovic because he had a crush on Brigitte, and that became our main topic of conversation. But after another 
month, things didn’t work out between them, and Brigitte later told me that they just weren’t compatible.</p>
					<p>They became my companions not just in college but in other aspects of life—going on trips, celebrating birthdays, 
playing Mobile Legends and PUBG, and all sorts of random fun. As of now, our friendship is solid. With Rhovic, it’s a 
give-and-take dynamic—though it may not seem like it, since I mostly help him with academics while he gives me 
advice about life. As for Brigitte, our friendship is also going well. What stands out the most about her is how genuine 
and sincere she is, especially during times when I felt really down—her concern always felt real. </p>
					<h3>Future Plan</h3>
					<p>I’m not really sure about my future plans yet. For now, I’ll just focus on achieving a sustainable source of income, 
maintaining passing grades, and maybe getting back into sports. I feel like once I graduate, it’ll be harder to play since 
there won’t be any intramurals to join. </p>
					<p>I’m also excited for my OJT—hopefully, I get assigned to Baguio. </p>
