        <dd>I want to become a frontend developer because it is simpler compared to backend development and involves fewer security concerns. It also allows for a more visual and interactive approach to building applications. Also, frontend roles are easier to apply for, providing more opportunities in the job market.</dd>
        <dt>Backend Developer</dt>
        <dd>I want to become a backend developer because it more on intensive coding and is a important part of web development. It mostly offers higher pay than frontend roles and it involves more logic-based problem-solving. Also, it doesnâ€™t require artistic skills since the UI is handled by frontend developers.</dd>
